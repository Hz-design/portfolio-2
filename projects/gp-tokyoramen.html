                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>In the past 5 years, I've been to Japan four times, mainly for its exquisite cuisine. Japanese food is known for its elegance, lightness, freshness, and sweetness. Every time I return, I'm captivated by it. Ramen is my go-to meal, suitable for almost any time of the day â€“ whether for lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack. My goal is to inspire young people to try Japanese Ramen, considering the vast and diverse selection available!</p>

                    <h3>Project Case</h3>
                    <h4>Main job:</h4>
                    <p>Researching</p>
                    <p>Sketching</p>
                    <p>Designing</p>

                    <h4>Date:</h4>
                    <p>2020.11.3</p>

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>In my design course, I learned about layering and overprinting. Layering and overprinting involve the effect of overlapping colors to create a new color over specific elements.</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience:</h4>
                    <p>Young people , because nowadays they are more open to new experiences.</p>

                    <h4>Mood</h4>
                    <p>The mood I want to set is elegance, </p>

                    <h4>Research phase | Mind mapping, mood boards, collage and sketching</h4>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/afbeelding_1.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>Before I chose ramen as my favorite food, it went through a selection process along with all my other favorite dishes. Creating a mind map proved incredibly useful, allowing me to organize my thoughts about all my preferred foods.
                        Next, I conducted research and gathered inspiration on the layering and overprinting style, ramen, and single-page websites.
                        Afterward, I came up with three keywords that are essential for me when it comes to ramen: Serenity, hot noodles, and focus.
                        Using the collage as a reference, I sketched the elements found within it.      
                        </p>
                

                    <h4>Experiment | color palette, food vector, food icons and typography</h4>
                        <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                            <img src="../img/afbeelding_2.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    <p>The color palette is derived from the colors present in the collage, with the main chosen colors being red and yellow. Throughout the style, I am allowed to use red and yellow along with their respective contrasts.
                        Subsequently, I created numerous sketches of the various types of ramen that exist. I opted for a top-down perspective as it provides a clear overview. I also experimented with different ingredients, various types of ceramic bowls, and toppings in all the ramen-related sketches.                        
                        I used Adobe Illustrator to vectorize the sketches, and below, you can see how I drew the ramen while experimenting with the layering and overprinting style.                        
                        The sketches were based on the elements found within the collage.</p>

                    <h4>First Version</h4>
                        <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                            <img src="../img/afbeelding_4.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    <p>The first three designs are each distinct from one another. Symmetry and dynamism were the main focus in my design, creating a flow from the soup to the chopsticks that guide your eyes in a zigzag pattern. Additionally, I considered the use of contrast, incorporating many elements from the collage into the designs.</p>

                    <h4>Second Version</h4>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/afbeelding_5.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>With the feedback I received, I arrived at this result. The three designs now bear more resemblance to each other, featuring noodles that span across the entire website, indicating that users can scroll down. The chopsticks guide the user's gaze from the title to the product, creating a visual flow and immediately offering an impression of the product.</p>

                    <h4>Layering and overprinting | Titles & vectors</h4>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/afbeelding_6.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>While designing, I contemplated a new title for the homepage. I aimed for a more playful title that incorporates the style more effectively.</p>

                    <h4>Pecha kucha | Overprinting en layering</h4>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/afbeelding_3.jpeg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>To better understand what my style entails I made a Pecha Kucha for my preferred style: Overprinting and layering.</p>
                    <a class="button" href="https://vimeo.com/545482397/290f65ac4a">Watch Pecha Kucha</a>
                        
                    <h4>Third Version</h4>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/afbeelding_9.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>To make the overprinting and layering style stand out better, I chose to give the colors a lighter tone. So that the focus can go more to the food than to the structure of the website.</p>

                    <h4>Order Button</h4>
                    <p>Below you can see the sketches of order buttons. It varies from simple buttons to buttons full of detail.</p>
                    <div class="wrapper-project-img">
                        <img src="../img/butons-01.jpeg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <h4>Final Version</h4>

                    <h5>Typography</h5>
                    <p>Font: Lato. Personally, I find this font to be very simple, making it easily readable. On the homepage, I created a typographic artwork using Lato (heavy) that blends Japanese script and the alphabetical script in my designated style.</p>

                    <h5>Composition | Layout</h5>
                    <p>The composition and layout: The noodles act as a guide throughout the page, being centered, providing a sense of symmetry at the beginning. As you reach the products, a lot of asymmetry comes into play. The chopsticks introduce an asymmetric feeling, leading you from the title to the product. After the products, it ends with a sense of symmetry at the contact section. It starts and ends with a sense of calmness.</p>

                    <h5>Gestalt Laws | the law of simplicity</h5>
                    <p>The principle of simplicity is predominantly evident in the food section. The products are recognizable and distinguishable with minimal details. I deliberately deviated from this principle by incorporating the Japanese cherry blossom at the welcome section on the homepage, aiming to encourage users to scroll down and generate interest. The fonts are distinct and only used when necessary. The design exudes a youthful and fresh feel, which, in my opinion, aligns well with my target audience.</p>

                    <h5>Gestalt Laws | the law of foreground and background</h5>
                    <p>Due to the overprinting and layering, distinguishing the foreground and background becomes challenging as they blend together. However, by using the noodles as a guide, it becomes clear where the user should focus. The order button is bright red, making it stand out from the other elements.</p>

                    <h5>Gestalt Laws | the law of proximity</h5>
                    <p>The text boxes have their own "paper-like frame," isolating them in their own space, preventing them from blending with the background, and allowing them enough white space to breathe. Each Ramen bowl has a pair of chopsticks pointing towards it, providing clarification in the asymmetric composition, creating a clear distinction between the chaotic background and the informative foreground.</p>

                    <h5>Reflection</h5>
                    <p>A good design involves numerous iterations, and I've learned that it's okay to make mistakes. While designing, I found it beneficial to have someone who can always provide feedback on my work. Seeing the design all the time can sometimes make it hard to spot potential issues, so getting an outside perspective is valuable. The more opinions I gathered, the more insights I discovered, leading to a continuous flow of inspiration and preventing me from getting stuck.</p>

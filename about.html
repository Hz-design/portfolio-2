                    <p>From a young age, I was captivated by the media and  the beauty of nature.
                        I succesfully completed my education as a graphic designer, during which I 
                        also explored the realms of photography and videography, gaining invaluable
                        experiences. Throughout my studies, I acquired knowledge and hands-on experience
                        in various design styles, video production, photography, work experiences, and
                        entrepreneurship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am pursuing further education with a focus on user experience,
                        aiming to eventually establish my own business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my leisure time, I enjoy activities such as bouldering, fitness, cooking,
                        playing the piano, and cherishing moments with my family and friends.
